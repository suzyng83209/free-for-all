# free-for-all

## This project was created for Elliot Technologies's coding challenge.
### The purpose was to create an algorithm that would read a csv file containing a list of events and find the largest block of time between 08:00 and 22:00 to host a meeting within one week of the request.

### A large part of this project incorporated copious amounts of momentjs.
